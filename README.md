# GLOE-Pipe

The **G**enomewide **L**igation of 3'-**O**H **E**nds sequencing (GLOE-Seq) is a sensitive method to capture DNA strand breaks genomewide at nucleotide resolution.

To facilitate the analysis of the raw GLOE-Seq data, we have developed an easy-to-use, modular and versatile computational pipeline, called **GLOE-Pipe**. The codebase for GLOE-Pipe can be found at <https://gitlab.com/GPetrosino/GLOE-Pipe>.
